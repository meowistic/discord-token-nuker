#  Setup

1. Download the newest version of [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. After downloading both of the files (`nuke.py`, `requirements.txt`), open your command prompt.
3. type  ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` into the command prompt, this will download all the required packages.
4. Open `nuke.py ` and enjoy the program!

# Configs Usage

To use configs, you need to have a `config.json` file in the same directory as the nuker, and it has to have the same structure as the `config.json` file in this repo. 
It is pretty self explanatory on how to use those configs, in the token field you add your bot's/user's token, prefix, nickname, and channel amount. After this just run `nuke.py` and the config will automatically import itself!
